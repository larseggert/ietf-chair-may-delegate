              draft-eggert-ietf-chair-may-delegate-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes that the IETF Chair may delegate some of their
   responsibilities to other Area Directors, and updates several
   existing RFCs to enable that.  It also proposes a succession of
   emergency stand-ins in case the IETF Chair becomes incapacitated.

1.  Introduction

   Throughout the history of the IETF, the role of the IETF Chair has
   always been filled by a single person.  None of the foundational
   documents of the organization precisely define the role, but most are
   written with an understanding that the role is filled by a single
   person who is then tasked with numerous responsibilities.  The
   expired Internet-Draft [I-D.carpenter-ietf-chair-tasks] attempted to
   define the role of the IETF Chair more precisely but was not taken
   forward.

   Few documents explicitly say that the IETF Chair may delegate some of
   these responsibilities.  Over time, this has created a situation
   where even a full-time commitment by a single person may no longer be
   sufficient to fulfill all of these roles and duties.

   Also, the role of the IETF Chair is a single point of failure for the
   organization, with no defined processes for allowing others to
   quickly and/or temporarily take over aspects of the role if the IETF
   Chair becomes partially or fully unable to serve.  (The defined
   process is that for "mid-term vacancies" per Section 3.5 of
   [RFC8713], which can take up to six weeks to complete and only allows
   for the permanent replacement of the IETF Chair by another
   individual.)

   Single bottlenecks like this have obvious scaling and fault tolerance
   issues.  This document hence proposes to explicitly allow the IETF
   Chair to delegate some of their responsibilities to one or more other
   Area Directors.  It leaves it up to each IETF Chair to determine if
   they would like to delegate some of their responsibilities, and if
   so, which ones, to whom and when.

   One model that is specifically enabled by this proposal, but is not
   required or even recommended, is a separation of the roles of the
   IETF Chair from that of the IESG Chair, allowing another Area
   Director to take over the chairperson role of the IESG and its
   associated responsibilities.  It also enables delegation of the IETF
   Chair's full IAB membership and delegation or sharing of the role of
   the General Area Director.

   Specifically, with these changes, it should be possible for the IESG
   to request the selection of a General Area Director who is not at the
   same time also the IETF Chair, to whom the IETF Chair may then
   delegate some of their responsibilities, such as chairing the IESG.

   There must be community transparency about which roles the IETF Chair
   has delegated to which other Area Director, and for which time.  This
   transparency can be guaranteed in several ways, such as through the
   IESG website or public email.  Such operational details are out of
   the scope of this document.

2.  Emergency Stand-In

   This section describes who may stand in for the IETF Chair in case of
   emergency if they become unable to fulfill their duties.

2.1.  Background

   As described in Section 1, the IETF Chair role is at the moment a
   single point of failure for the organization.  In an emergency that
   incapacitated the IETF Chair, a recall petition followed by executing
   a "mid-term vacancy" replacement would need to be executed to name a
   new IETF Chair.  This process will likely take several weeks at best,
   during which time there is no defined stand-in for the IETF Chair.

      |  Section 7.1.1 of [RFC8713] currently prevents NomCom-ineligible
      |  IETF participants from being signatories on recall petitions.
      |  This includes anyone serving in a NomCom-selected role.  This
      |  could be an issue, since IESG, IAB and LLC Board members may be
      |  first-hand witnesses to reasons that would merit an IETF Chair
      |  recall, but they are currently unable to initiate one directly.

2.2.  Proposal

   This document proposes that in the case the IETF Chair becomes
   incapacitated, the IAB Chair will automatically assume the role of
   the IETF Chair.  If the IAB Chair is unable to do so, the IETF Chair
   role will automatically fall to the Chair of the IETF Administration
   LLC.  As soon as the NomCom appoints a new IETF Chair this emergency
   delegation ends.

3.  Separating the IETF Chair and IESG Chair Roles

   This section analyzes which RFCs imply that the IETF Chair and IESG
   Chair roles need to be filled by the same person, and makes
   suggestions for updates that would allow a separation.

3.1.  Background

   [RFC2026] is surprisingly silent on the role of the IETF Chair, only
   mentioning it in Section 14 of [RFC2026] as part of the terminology:

      Area Director - The manager of an IETF Area.  The Area Directors
      along with the IETF Chair comprise the Internet Engineering
      Steering Group (IESG).

      Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) - A group comprised of
      the IETF Area Directors and the IETF Chair. (...)

   Similarly, the role of the IESG Chair is only briefly mentioned in
   Section 6.5.2 of [RFC2026] as part of how process failures are
   handled:

      If an individual should disagree with an action taken by the IESG
      in this process, that person should first discuss the issue with
      the IESG Chair.  If the IESG Chair is unable to satisfy the
      complainant then (...)

   [RFC2026] does not require the IETF Chair to also fulfill the role of
   IESG Chair.  Section 1.2 of [RFC1602], the earlier revision of the
   standards process that [RFC2026] obsoletes, is an Informational RFC
   and does include text to that effect, however:

      The IESG is composed of the IETF Area Directors and the
      chairperson of the IETF, who also serves as the chairperson of the
      IESG.

   Section 1.2 of [RFC1602] is likely the basis for [RFC2028], a BCP
   that includes similar text:

      The IESG is composed of the IETF Area Directors and the chair of
      the IETF, who also serves as the chair of the IESG.

   Section 3.3 of [RFC9281], a BCP that obsoletes [RFC2028], retains
   that text and also states that the IETF Chair is the Area Director
   for the General Area:

      The IESG is composed of the ADs and the IETF Chair.  The IETF
      Chair also chairs the IESG and is the AD for the General Area.

   Section 4 of [RFC4949], an Informational RFC containing an Internet
   Security Glossary, contains this text under the "Internet Engineering
   Steering Group (IESG)" glossary item:

      The part of the ISOC responsible for technical management of IETF
      activities and administration of the Internet Standards Process
      according to procedures approved by the ISOC Trustees.  Directly
      responsible for actions along the "standards track", including
      final approval of specifications as Internet Standards.  Composed
      of IETF Area Directors and the IETF chairperson, who also chairs
      the IESG.  (RFC 2026)

3.2.  Proposal

   To allow the IETF Chair to delegate the role of IESG Chair to another
   AD (as arguably intended to be allowed by [RFC2026]), the following
   updates to existing RFCs are proposed:

   1.  Remove the sentence "The IETF Chair also chairs the IESG and is
       the AD for the General Area." from Section 3.3 of [RFC9281].

   2.  Change the clause "The IETF chair, who is also the chair of the
       Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)" in the second
       sentence of Section 1 of [RFC2850] to "The IETF chair or their
       delegate".  (This is also part of the suggestions in
       Section 5.2.)

   3.  Remove the clause "who also chairs the IESG" from the "Internet
       Engineering Steering Group (IESG)" glossary item in Section 4 of
       [RFC4949].

4.  Delegation of the IAB Membership

   This section analyzes which RFCs contain text about the full IAB
   membership of the IETF Chair, and makes suggestions for updates that
   would allow delegation of the IAB membership.

4.1.  Background

   Section 1 of [RFC2850] requires the IETF Chair to be a full member of
   the IAB:

      The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) shall consist of thirteen
      full members, composed of the chair of the Internet Engineering
      Task Force (IETF), and of twelve sitting members.

   Appendix C of [RFC8713] contains a similar statement as part of the
   second item in a list of "oral traditions" recorded for
   "consideration by future NomComs":

      No person should serve both on the IAB and as an Area Director,
      except the IETF Chair whose roles as an IAB member and Area
      Director of the General Area are set out elsewhere.

   Section 3.4 of [RFC9281] says:

      The IETF Chair is also a member of the IAB, and the Chair of the
      Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) is an ex officio member.

4.2.  Proposal

   To allow the IETF Chair to delegate their full IAB membership to
   another AD, the following updates to existing RFCs are suggested:

   1.  Add "or their Delegate Area Director" at the end of the clause
       "composed of the chair of the Internet Engineering Task Force
       (IETF)" in Section 1 of [RFC2850].

   2.  Add "With the publication of RFCXXXX, IETF guidance on this issue
       has changed as described there." to the second bullet item in
       Appendix C of [RFC8713].

   3.  Change the sentence "The IETF Chair is also a member of the IAB,
       and the Chair of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) is an ex
       officio member." to "The Chair of the Internet Research Task
       Force (IRTF) is an ex officio member of the IAB." in Section 3.4
       of [RFC9281].

5.  Delegation of the General Area Director Role

   This section analyzes which RFCs contain text about the
   responsibility of the IETF Chair to also serve as Area Director of
   the General Area, and makes suggestions for updates that would allow
   delegation of or sharing of the role.

5.1.  Background

   Section 2 of [RFC3710] states that the IETF Chair is the General Area
   Director:

      The IETF Chair, who also functions as the General Area Director
      when this area is active

   Section 3.3 of [RFC9281] also makes a similar statement:

      The IETF Chair also chairs the IESG and is the AD for the General
      Area.

5.2.  Proposal

   To allow the IETF Chair to delegate the Area Director role of the
   General Area, the following updates to existing RFCs are suggested:

   1.  Replace "who also functions as the General Area Director" with
       "who may also function as a General Area Director or may share
       that role with or delegate that role to another Area Director" in
       Section 2 of [RFC3710].

   2.  Change the clause "The IETF chair, who is also the chair of the
       Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)" in the second
       sentence of Section 1 of [RFC2850] to "The IETF chair or their
       delegate".  (This is also part of the suggestions in
       Section 3.2.)

6.  Other Updates

   This section collects updates to some text in existing RFCs that has
   become stale.

6.1.  Staff Supervision

   Section 7.1 of [RFC3710] says

      The IETF Chair has primary responsibility for supervising the work
      of the IETF Secretariat, with the advice and consent of the IESG,
      the IAB Chair and the ISOC president.

   With the publication of [RFC8711], this responsibility has moved to
   the IETF Executive Director.  The proposal is to update Section 7.1
   of [RFC3710] to remove the sentence above.

7.  Other Roles

   This section briefly summarizes other roles the IETF Chair has, but
   which require no updates, usually because delegation is already
   permitted.

7.1.  Liaison Statements

   Section 3.1 of [RFC4691] says

      Liaison statements are only sent on the initiative of the IETF
      chair, the IAB chair, IETF Area Directors, or IETF working group
      chairs.

   Section 4 of [RFC4052] says

      For a liaison statement generated on behalf of the IETF as a
      whole, the IETF Chair must have generated or must agree with the
      sending of the liaison statement.  If the liaison statement is not
      sent by the IETF Chair, then his or her agreement must be obtained
      in advance and confirmed by copying the IETF Chair on the message.

   The combination of these two statements already allows another Area
   Director to send a liaison statement on behalf of the IETF with IETF
   Chair approval.

7.2.  Transgressions of the IETF Guidelines for Conduct

   Appendix A of [RFC7154] says "An individual can report transgressions
   of the guidelines for conduct to the IETF Chair or the IESG."

   However, [RFC7154] does not define any reactions the IETF Chair or
   the IESG should or may take, so the IETF Chair only acts as a
   recipient here.

7.3.  Managing the Ombuds- and Moderator Teams

   The IETF Chair is tasked with managing the constituency of the
   ombudsteam [RFC7776] and the moderator team of the IETF discussion
   list [RFC9245].

   This document does not suggest any changes here, but the community
   may consider allowing delegation of either of these responsibilities
   if revisions of [RFC7776] or [RFC9245] are undertaken.

7.4.  Serving on the IETF LLC Board

   [RFC8711] suggests that the IETF Chair, or a delegate selected by the
   IESG, will serve on the Board of Directors of the IETF Administration
   LLC.  Because delegation of that role is already explicitly allowed,
   no changes are suggested here.

8.  Security Considerations

   The usual security considerations [RFC3552] do not apply to this
   document.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
